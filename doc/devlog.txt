Added DEADLINES FOLLOW THEM PLEASE!!!!

Code base: Finished writing the login system. Wrote the database, html, and backend logic. There is no bootstrap, just raw HTML.

alexO -- 2019-11-19 1:20
Created to21help.py and to21test.py which will store helper functions and facilitate the creation of To21
  - created To21 database and 'gameinfo' table
  - created several sql functions to facilitate the manipulation of 'gameinfo'
  - attempted to begin incorporating my API although ran into several issues

devinL -- 2019-11-19 8:50
Started rick and morty database. Made a separate .py file to hold the helper function to cache the rick and morty api.

williamC -- 2019-11-19 17:54
Code base: Wrote page and logic to bet amount on a game. Fixed bug of viewing routes that required login when user is not logged in.
Design document: Updated how session will be handled

mohidulA -- 2019-11-19 18:15
Updated devlog to fix issues (eg adding a heading and formatting)
NEW DEADLINES

devinL -- 2019-11-19 22:00
Finished with function to cache rick and morty api.
changed database_query and database_builder with the addition of a rick and morty database and functions to work with said database.
Coded the basic route for rick and morty game and made a very basic html page.
At this point, the program is able to display a random image of a character from rick and morty upon refreshing the page.

williamC -- 2019-11-20 9:54
Cached pokemon data (only to JSON not DB)

alexO -- 2019-11-21 21:48
FINALLY discovered reason behind codebreaking bug when attempting to work with my API
I discovered that packages such as "Request" were being installed under python2.7 automatically rather than python3
Created API helper functions within to21help.py
Completed creation of all helper functions I believe will be necessary and thoroughly tested them

MAWD -- 2019-11-20 18:11
THe issue of ego hindering work exists in almost any field, but it seems more prevalent in the field of computer science. The article does a really good job explaioning how to avoid those problems using proper examples. We personally liked the interaction between Bill and Marilyn, mostly because Bill laughing at his own horrible code was relatable.
THINGS WE WILL DO
  - The PM will make sure to assist any and all members with their part of the project, and the other members should also help eachother out even if they are working on different games.
  - We will make the environment as friendly as possible, especially for code review
  - Each programmer will try to reach out and ask for help when needed

alexO -- 2019-11-21 19:23
Determined I needed to improve my database. Before it only stored 'deckid'(necessary for my API), 'userTotal'(user's current score in To21) and 'dealerTotal'(dealer's current score in To21)
Now my table stores the number of cards drawn by the player and dealer as well, as I feel this is information the user deserves to have
Created general skeletons of To21 app.py routes and corresponding html files

williamC -- 2019-11-21 23:05
Finished caching data and reading into DB (brought initialization time from 4s to .13s).
Wrote init.sh to make initializing database easier ("$ ./init.sh" to run)
Updated README.md with instructions to run the program and initialize the database

williamC -- 2019-11-22 13:03
Added instructions to create virtual environment and install required packages. Added more automation to init.sh for
user setting up the server

williamC -- 2019-11-23 00:028
Finished logic for determining who wins in pokemon game and wrote tests (automated testing)

williamC -- 2019-11-23 13:36
Finished writing game for Pokemon Versus. The biggest bug to fix now is a user going back and forward in history
from browser. Code is very messy, missing comments, terrible variable names, will need to be fixed.

olteanuA -- 2019-11-23 22:34
Finished /to21 and /to21/initilize routes in app.py
Finished corresponding html files to completed routes: to21home.html, to21start.html
Finished properly linking all routes and html files
All I have left to do is work out and incorporate the math/calculations behind To21. This should be easy because of the completion of previously mentioned helper functions

williamC -- 2019-11-24 15:14
Cleaned up variable names and code logic. Also used Blueprints to fix

MAWD -- 2019-11-25 09:21

Firefox has a feature where going back in history uses the cache page instead of asking the server to send info again. This caused a bug of user being able to play multiple games of same cards. This is fixed now.

williamC -- 2019-11-26
Removed all database binary files from master branch.
Retrieve and store currency exchange rates.

olteanuA 2019-11-27 3:35
Completed To21 as a standalone game (almost). Currently game-state is managed through hardcode within /to21/initialize
William asked that instead I do so through the usage of sessions. This will most likely be done and completed in class tomorrow.
The game looks basic as only fundamental and necessary aspects of the game has been incorporated
Now I can focus on aesthetic and smaller features

mohidulA 2019-11-27 10:49
Updated database for games in the design docs
changed some instructions for R&M and pokemon game
Clarified the balance system (and the test user starts with MAWD$1000)

williamC -- 2019-11-28
Can now add MAWDollars. We are not having any checks for credit card info because that is NOT the focus of the project.
Result page of pokemon will show how much was gain or lost.
All pokemon choices are no unique to the player (user and computer can share the same pokemon, however)

williamC -- 2019-11-29 23:34
Added bootstrap to the project (templating). Remodeled the entire pokemon game (but not the betting page).
Fixed bug of being able to change bet amount mid game.
Added ability to leave a game. (Kinda uselss, might remove)

olteanuA -- 2019-11-30 00:59
Introduced the usage of sessions to maintain all user and dealer cards, allowing me to display each hand in true To21 fashion.
Ran into an issue though where for some reason session["userHand"] fails to update in html, although prints the desired result in terminal.
  - the bug is in line 250 of app.py.
  - line 251 has a print command where the user's hand is properly displayed. however, upon attempting to display in html the user's hand does not change from its original state.
Polished code by removing unnecessary and redundant code and variables, and improved overall neatness.
Addressed certain bugs in the algorithms behind calculating hands and results.

williamC -- 2019-11-30 17:23
Added instructions to Pokemon game. Made what pokemon were chosen more noticeable.

alexO -- 2019-12-02 00:31
"Bootstrapified" all of To21:
  - created a general overarching theme
  - made my html pages far more vivid and captivating to the eye
  - introduced being able to view all of the user and dealer cards as actual "cards" through the usage of Bootstrap grids
I've essentially planned out and incorporated most of my Bootstrap aspirations and will finish tomorrow.
Still have not been able to fix bug where user cards update and appropriately display upon being dealt a new card though, thus, I will visit the dojo tomorrow.

alexO -- 2019-12-03 3:45
"Bootstrapified" to21rules.html, game.html
  - to21rules now has To21 theme
  - game.html no longer looks bland, including images that redirect to appropriate game upon being clicked
Made final bootstrap modifications to all To21 html files in order to achieve desired aesthetic result
Made final tweaks to To21 calculation algorithms and fixed bugs
Completed final code polish for To21 game

mohidulA -- 2019-12-03 17:50
Users no longer start of with free money
Updated the pokemon game rules in teh design doc
Added the due date (oops)
Changed parts of the to21 game

alexO -- 2019-12-03 15:54
Reworked code to allow the display of physical card images
Further polished bootstrap and html to make To21 look even better. I keep coming up with new ideas.
Incorporated images in game.html to make it look cooler

williamC -- 2019-12-03 16:45
Finished the README.md (how to set up the python environment and run the program. Removed init.sh)
Added a back button to the instruction pages
