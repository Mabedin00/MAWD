        <center><p class="text-white"> To21 starts with players making wagers </p></center>

        <center><p class="text-white"> The dealer deals 2 cards to the players and two to himself (1 card face up, the other face down) </p></center>

        <center><p class="text-white"> All cards count their face value in blackjack.
                    Picture cards count as 10 and the ace can count as either 1 or 11. </p></center>

        <center><p class="text-white">Card suits have no meaning in To21.
        The total of any hand is the sum of the card values in the hand</p></center>

        <center><p class="text-white"> Players must decide whether to stand or hit.
                    By hitting, the player draws another card.
                    By standing, the player chooses to keep their hand as is</p></center>

        <center><p class="text-white"> The dealer acts last </p></center>

        <center><p class="text-white"> Players win when their hand totals higher than dealerâ€™s hand.
                    Or, they have 21 or less when the dealer busts (i.e., exceeds 21) </p></center>

        <center><p class="text-white">If the player, wins they recieve twice back their wager</p></center>

        <center><p class="text-white">If the player, loses they lose their wager</p></center>

        <center><p class="text-white">If there is a tie, the player simply keeps their wager</p></center>

        <center><p class="text-white">Lastly, have fun!</p></center>
